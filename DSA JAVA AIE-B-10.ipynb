    "## **Introduction:**  \n",
    "The Smart Parking Management System (SPMS) is designed to optimize the use of parking spaces in urban areas. With the increasing number of vehicles and limited parking availability, an efficient system is essential for managing parking resources. This system will utilize a Binary Search Tree (BST) to track parking space availability, implement real-time parking slot allocation, and support dynamic pricing based on occupancy levels. The goal is to provide a seamless experience for users while maximizing the utilization of parking spaces.\n"

    "## **Incorporation of OOP & DSA**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles:\n",
    "**1. Encapsulation: Secure and Modular Parking System**\n",
    "- **Data Hiding:** Essential parking data, such as slot availability, vehicle details, and payment transactions, is encapsulated within appropriate classes.\n",
    "- **Modularity:** The system is structured into independent modules (e.g., ParkingLot, ParkingSlot, User, Payment), making it easy to maintain and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Inheritance:** Special Slot Types for Optimized Allocation\n",
    "- **Hierarchy of Parking Slots:** The ParkingSlot class serves as a base class, while VIPSlot, EVSlot, and GeneralSlot inherit and extend functionality.\n",
    "- **Custom Rules for Slot Allocation:** VIP slots might have priority reservations, while EV slots have integrated charging stations.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** New slot types (e.g., handicap-accessible, subscription-based parking) can be easily added without affecting existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Polymorphism:** Flexible and Adaptive Pricing Models\n",
    "- **Dynamic Pricing Strategies:** Different vehicles (e.g., regular, VIP, EV) may have varying pricing structures.\n",
    "- **Method Overriding for Custom Pricing:** A base class method calculatePrice() is overridden in specialized classes to implement different billing mechanisms based on time, demand, and occupancy levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Abstraction:** User-Friendly Interactions\n",
    "- **Simplified User Experience:** Users interact with a high-level interface (web/app) that abstracts complex slot allocation and pricing logic.\n",
    "- **Unified API for Integrations:** The system exposes REST APIs for seamless integration with mobile apps and payment gateways without revealing underlying logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):\n",
    "**1. BST (Binary Search Tree):** Efficient parking slot search & management\n",
    "- **Fast Slot Allocation:** The parking system uses a BST to store available parking slots, enabling quick insertion, deletion, and lookup.\n",
    "- **Efficient Range Queries:** BST supports efficient searching of nearest available slots based on vehicle type, price, and user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. HashMap:** Fast Retrieval of Pricing & User Data\n",
    "- **Dynamic Pricing Storage:** A HashMap stores slot-wise dynamic pricing information based on occupancy rate, time of day, and demand trends.\n",
    "- **Quick Lookup for User Details:** User parking history, reservation status, and payment details are mapped using a key-value data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Queues:** Managing Real-Time Parking Requests\n",
    "- **First-Come, First-Served Slot Assignment:** Incoming parking requests are handled using a queue, ensuring fair allocation.\n",
    "- **Waiting List Management:** If a slot is unavailable, the system places users in a priority queue until a space is freed."

    "## **Code Structure and Design:**\n",
    "The code structure of the SPMS is organized into several classes and functions, each responsible for specific functionalities. This modular design promotes code reusability, maintainability, and clarity. Below is an overview of the main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Class Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Parking Lot Attributes:**\n",

    "Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "insert(space): Inserts a new parking space into the BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "delete(space_id): Deletes a parking space from the BST.\n",

    "find_min(): Finds the minimum value (available space).\n",
    "\n",
    "in_order_traversal(): Traverses the BST in order to list available spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Organization\n",
    "The functions within each class are designed to perform specific tasks, ensuring that the code remains organized and easy to follow. For example, the allocate_space() function in the ParkingLot class will interact with the BinarySearchTree to find and allocate the next available space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Identification of the Data Structures:**\n",
    "The primary data structure used in the Smart Parking Management System is the Binary Search Tree (BST). The BST is chosen for its efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, which are essential for managing parking space availability in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search Tree (BST)\n",
    "Node Structure: Each node in the BST will represent a parking space and will contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "space_id: Unique identifier for the parking space.\n",
    "\n",
    "is_occupied: Boolean indicating if the space is occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "price: Current price for the parking space.\n",
    "\n",
    "left: Pointer to the left child node.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dictionary: To map space_id to ParkingSpace objects for quick lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data Preparation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation involves initializing the parking lot with a set number of parking spaces and setting their initial states. The following steps outline the data preparation process:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialize Parking Spaces:\n",
    "Create a list of ParkingSpace objects, each with a unique space_id, an initial is_occupied status set to False, and a default price.\n",
    "Insert into BST:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each ParkingSpace object, insert it into the BinarySearchTree using the insert() method. This will allow for efficient tracking of available spaces.\n",
    "Set Initial Pricing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Set the initial pricing for each parking space based on predetermined criteria (e.g., location, time of day).\n",
    "Monitor Occupancy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a mechanism to monitor the occupancy of each parking space in real-time, updating the is_occupied status as vehicles enter and exit.\n",
    "Dynamic Pricing Logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a pricing algorithm that adjusts the price of parking spaces based on occupancy levels. For example, as occupancy increases, prices may rise to encourage turnover and maximize revenue.\n"
